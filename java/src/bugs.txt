Bug 1: 
Null pointer exception when initiating a coin flip to see who goeas firse 

Location: Board.displayBoard(Board.java:21)

Cause: Forgot to initialize board before displaying it. Resulting in a reference to a null array

Bug 2:
X and O is missaligned

Cause: No padding provided by empty string

Solution: add extra whitespace to allign board components


Bug 3:
whoever goes first is stuck in an infinite loop where they keep playing.

Cause: Uname matched so it seemed like this was the case but it wasn't.

Solution: assigned correct usernames

Bug 4:
When game is reset it ends as soon as it begins

cause: turns our set to both false and our never switched back

Solution: Allow whoever wins the game to make the first move
